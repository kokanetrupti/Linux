# groupadd admin
# useradd -G admin harry
# useradd -G admin natasha

-The ﬁle /var/tmp/fstab should not be executable by anyone.
-The other  users are able to read and write /var/tmp/fstab.

# cp -rfv /etc/fstab /var/tmp/
# chmod a-x,o=rw /var/tmp/fstab

Ownership:
`
1) User owner:

# chown username file/dir

2) Group Owner:

# chgrp groupname file/dir
ACL: [ Access Control List]
`

# setfacl -m u:harry:rw- file/dir
